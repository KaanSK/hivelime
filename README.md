# HiveLime
Hivelime is a comprehensive integration between [TheHive](https://www.strangebee.com/thehive/) and [Sublime](https://sublimesecurity.com/). Utilizing Sublime webhooks, Hivelime can be effortlessly configured to create alerts on TheHive!

# Functionalities
* Triggered event (malicious email detection) is parsed and converted into an actionable TheHive alert with tags, observables;
* Request signing can be used if `SUBLIME_SIGNING_KEY` variable is provided;
* Observables have detailed tags to further analyze, filter or use in remediation step;
* Built with both Security and OPS in mind. _HiveLime_ has small footprint, great performance on various workloads and easily deployable with minimal configuration;
* Tags can be provided in configuration to be appended to alerts created by _HiveLime_;
* Alert has a brief summary description with links to detection, flagged rules and important information.
